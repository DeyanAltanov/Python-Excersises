Calculate Logarithm
Write a program that prints the calculated logarithm of any given number
Input
•	On the first line you will receive the number (an integer)
•	On the second line you will receive a number, which is the base of the logarithm. It can be either a number or the word "natural"
The output should be formatted to the 2nd decimal digit.

ASCII Art
Write a program that encrypts given words by using the characters: "-|_/\()" to structure the word. Use the pyfiglet module. 
Directions
1.	First you need to install the module that we will be using. To install it go to Setting --> Project <your_project_name> --> Project Interpreter --> + --> search for pyfiglet --> install package. 
2.	Import the module
3.	Implement the logic. We will be using the figlet_format method

Triangle
Create a module for printing a triangle. You will receive an integer number, which is the size of the triangle.

Mathematical operations
Create a module that does basic calculations. You will receive 2 numbers and a sign between them all in one string
Input
You will receive a single string in the following format
"{number1} {sign} {number2}"
o	number1 - a float number in the range (0.0, 1000.0)
o	sign - a char that can be
'/' - divide the first number with the second
'*' - multiply the 2 numbers 
'-' - subtract the first number with the second
'+' - add the 2 numbers
'^' - raise the first number to the second
o	number2 - an integer number in the range (0, 1000)
Output
Print only the result of the operation
The result should be formatted to the second decimal point

Fibonacci Sequence
Create a module that can create a Fibonacci sequence up to a number (count of numbers in the sequence) and print them, separating them with a single space.
You will be receiving commands until the "Stop" command. The commands are:
•	"Create Sequence {count}". Create series of numbers up to a specific count and print them in the following format:
           "{n1} {n2} … {n}"
•	"Locate {number}"
Check if the sequence contains the number. If, it finds the number it should print:
"The number - {number} is at index {index}"
And if it doesn't find it:
"The number {number} is not in the sequence"
Input
•	You will be receiving commands until the "Stop" command.  All inputs will be valid.
Output
•	Print the output of every command in the format described above.
