Store
Create a class called Store. Upon initialization it should receive a name (str), type (str), capacity (int). The store should also have an attribute called items (dictionary that stores name of an item and its quantity). The class should have 4 methods:

Integer
Create a class called Integer. Upon initialization it should receive a single parameter value (int). It should have 4 methods:
