Match Full Name
Write a program to match full names from a list of names and print them on the console.
Writing the Regular Expression
First, write a regular expression to match a valid full name, according to these conditions:
•	A valid full name has the following characteristics:
•	It consists of two words.
•	Each word starts with a capital letter.
•	After the first letter, it only contains lowercase letters afterwards.
•	Each of the two words should be at least two letters long.
•	The two words are separated by a single space.

Match Phone Number
Write a regular expression to match a valid phone number from Sofia. After you find all valid phones, print them on the console, separated by a comma and a space ", ".
Compose the Regular Expression
A valid number has the following characteristics:
•	It starts with "+359"
•	Then, it is followed by the area code (always 2)
•	After that, it's followed by the number itself:
•	The number consists of 7 digits (separated in two groups of 3 and 4 digits respectively). 
•	The different parts are separated by either a space or a hyphen ('-').
You can use the following RegEx properties to help with the matching: 
•	Use quantifiers to match a specific number of digits
•	Use a capturing group to make sure the delimiter is only one of the allowed characters (space or hyphen) and not a combination of both (e.g. +359 2-111 111 has mixed delimiters, it is invalid). Use a group backreference to achieve this.
•	Add a word boundary at the end of the match to avoid partial matches (the last example on the right-hand side).
•	Ensure that before the '+' sign there is either a space or the beginning of the string.

Match Dates
Write a program, which matches a date in the format "dd{separator}MMM{separator}yyyy". Use capturing groups in your regular expression.
Compose the Regular Expression
Every valid date has the following characteristics:
•	Always starts with two digits, followed by a separator
•	After that, it has one uppercase and two lowercase letters (e.g. Jan, Mar).
•	After that, it has a separator and exactly 4 digits (for the year).
•	The separator could be either of three things: a period ("."), a hyphen ("-") or a forward slash ("/")
•	The separator needs to be the same for the whole date (e.g. 13.03.2016 is valid, 13.03/2016 is NOT). Use a group backreference to check for this.

Match Numbers
Write a program, which finds all integer and floating-point numbers in a string.
Compose the Regular Expression
A number has the following characteristics:
•	Has either whitespace before it or the start of the string (match either ^ or what's called a positive lookbehind). The entire syntax for the beginning of your RegEx might look something like "(^|(?<=\s))".
•	The number might or might not be negative, so it might have a hyphen on its left side ("-").
•	Consists of one or more digits.
•	Might or might not have digits after the decimal point
•	The decimal part (if it exists) consists of a period (".") and one or more digits after it. Use a capturing group.
•	Has either whitespace before it or the end of the string (match either $ or what's called a positive lookahead). The syntax for the end of the RegEx might look something like "($|(?=\s))".

Capture the Numbers
Write a program that finds all numbers in a sequence of strings.
The output is all the numbers, extracted and printed on a single line – each separated by a single space.

Find Variable Names in Sentences
Write a program that finds all variable names in a given string. A variable name starts with an underscore ("_") and contains only Capital and Non-Capital English Alphabet letters and digits. Extract only their names, without the underscore. Try to do this only with regular expressions.
The output consists of all variable names, extracted and printed on a single line, each separated by a comma.

Find Occurrences of Word in Sentence
Write a program that finds, how many times a given word, is used in a given sentence. Note that letter case does not matter – it is case-insensitive.
The output is a single number indicating the amount of times the sentence contains the word.

Extract Emails
Write a program to extract all email addresses from a given text. The text comes at the only input line. Print the emails on the console, each at a separate line. Emails are considered to be in format <user>@<host>, where: 
•	<user> is a sequence of letters and digits, where '.', '-' and '_' can appear between them.
•	Examples of valid users: "stephan", "mike03", "s.johnson", "st_steward", "softuni-bulgaria", "12345".
•	Examples of invalid users: ''--123", ".....", "nakov_-", "_steve", ".info". 
•	<host> is a sequence of at least two words, separated by dots '.'. Each word is sequence of letters and can have hyphens '-' between the letters.
•	Examples of hosts: "softuni.bg", "software-university.com", "intoprogramming.info", "mail.softuni.org". 
•	Examples of invalid hosts: "helloworld", ".unknown.soft.", "invalid-host-", "invalid-". 
•	Examples of valid emails: info@softuni-bulgaria.org, kiki@hotmail.co.uk, no-reply@github.com, s.peterson@mail.uu.net, info-bg@software-university.software.academy. 
•	Examples of invalid emails: --123@gmail.com, …@mail.bg, .info@info.info, _steve@yahoo.cn, mike@helloworld, mike@.unknown.soft., s.johnson@invalid-.

Furniture
Write a program to calculate the total cost of different types of furniture. You will be given some lines of input until you receive the line "Purchase". For the line to be valid, it should be in the following format:
">>{furniture name}<<{price}!{quantity}"
The price can be floating point number or whole number. Store the names of the furniture and the total price. At the end print the each bought furniture on separate line in the format:
"Bought furniture:
{1st name}
{2nd name}
…"
And on the last line print the following: "Total money spend: {spend money}" formatted to the second decimal point.

Extract the Links
Write a program that extracts links from a given text. The text will come in the form of strings, each representing a sentence. You need to extract only the valid links from it.
The Sub-Domain must always be "www". The Domain name can consist of English alphabet letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits and dashes ("–"). The Domain extension consists of one or more domain blocks, a domain block consists of a dot followed by one or more lowercase English alphabet letters, a Domain extension must have at least one domain block in order to be valid. The Sub-Domain and Domain name must be separated by a single dot. Any link that does NOT follow the specified above rules should be treated as invalid.

Race
Write a program that processes information about a race. On the first line you will be given list of participants separated by ", ". On the next few lines until you receive a line "end of race" you will be given some info, which will be some alphanumeric characters. In between them, you could have some extra characters which you should ignore. For example: "G!32e%o7r#32g$235@!2e". The letters are the name of the person and the sum of the digits is the distance he ran. So here, we have George who ran 29 km. Store the information about the person only if the list of racers contains the name of the person. If you receive the same person more than once just add the distance to his old distance. At the end, print the top 3 racers ordered by distance in descending in the format:
"1st place: {first racer}
2nd place: {second racer}
3rd place: {third racer}"

Bar Income
Until you receive a line with text "end of shift" you will be given lines of input. But before processing that line you have to do some validations first.
Each valid order should have a customer, product, count and a price:
•	Valid customer's name should be surrounded by '%' and must start with a capital letter, followed by lower-case letters
•	Valid product contains any word character and must be surrounded by '<' and '>' 
•	Valid count is an integer, surrounded by '|'
•	Valid price is any real number followed by '$'
The parts of a valid order should appear in the order given: customer, product, count and a price.
Between each part there can be other symbols, except ('|', '$', '%' and '.')
For each valid line print on the console: "{customerName}: {product} - {totalPrice}"
When you receive "end of shift" print the total amount of money for the day rounded to 2 decimal places in the following format: "Total income: {income}".
Input / Constraints
•	Strings that you have to process until you receive text "end of shift".
Output
•	Print all of the valid lines in the format "{customerName}: {product} - {totalPrice}"
•	After receiving "end of shift" print the total amount of money for the day rounded to 2 decimal places in the following format: "Total income: {income}"
•	Allowed working time / memory: 100ms / 16MB.

Star Enigma
The war is in its peak, but you, young Padawan, can turn the tides with your programming skills. You are tasked to create a program to decrypt the messages of The Order and prevent the death of hundreds of lives. 
You will receive several messages, which are encrypted using the legendary star enigma. You should decrypt the messages, following these rules:
To properly decrypt a message, you should count all the letters [s, t, a, r] – case insensitive and remove the count from the current ASCII value of each symbol of the encrypted message.
After decryption:
Each message should have a planet name, population, attack type ('A', as attack or 'D', as destruction) and soldier count.
The planet name starts after '@' and contains only letters from the Latin alphabet. 
The planet population starts after ':' and is an Integer;
The attack type may be "A"(attack) or "D"(destruction) and must be surrounded by "!" (exclamation mark).
The soldier count starts after "->" and should be an Integer.
The order in the message should be: planet name -> planet population -> attack type -> soldier count. Each part can be separated from the others by any character except: '@', '-', '!', ':' and '>'.
Input / Constraints
•	The first line holds n – the number of messages– integer in range [1…100];
•	On the next n lines, you will be receiving encrypted messages.
Output
After decrypting all messages, you should print the decrypted information in the following format:
First print the attacked planets, then the destroyed planets.
"Attacked planets: {attackedPlanetsCount}"
"-> {planetName}"
"Destroyed planets: {destroyedPlanetsCount}"
"-> {planetName}"
The planets should be ordered by name alphabetically.

Nether Realms
Mighty battle is coming. In the stormy nether realms, demons are fighting against each other for supremacy in a duel from which only one will survive. 
Your job, however is not so exciting. You are assigned to sign in all the participants in the nether realm's mighty battle's demon book, which of course is sorted alphabetically. 
A demon's name contains his health and his damage. 
The sum of the asci codes of all characters (excluding numbers (0-9), arithmetic symbols ('+', '-', '*', '/') and delimiter dot ('.')) gives a demon's total health. 
The sum of all numbers in his name forms his base damage. Note that you should consider the plus '+' and minus '-' signs (e.g. +10 is 10 and -10 is -10). However, there are some symbols ('*' and '/') that can further alter the base damage by multiplying or dividing it by 2 (e.g. in the name "m15*/c-5.0", the base damage is 15 + (-5.0) = 10 and then you need to multiply it by 2 (e.g. 10 * 2 = 20) and then divide it by 2 (e.g. 20 / 2 = 10)). 
So, multiplication and division are applied only after all numbers are included in the calculation and in the order they appear in the name. 
You will get all demons on a single line, separated by commas and zero or more blank spaces. Sort them in alphabetical order and print their names along their health and damage. 
Input
The input will be read from the console. The input consists of a single line containing all demon names separated by commas and zero or more spaces in the format: "{demon name}, {demon name}, … {demon name}"
Output
Print all demons sorted by their name in ascending order, each on a separate line in the format:
•	"{demon name} - {health points} health, {damage points} damage"
Constraints
•	A demon's name will contain at least one character
•	A demon's name cannot contain blank spaces ' ' or commas ','
•	A floating point number will always have digits before and after its decimal separator
•	Number in a demon's name is considered everything that is a valid integer or floating point number (with dot '.' used as separator). For example, all these are valid numbers: '4', '+4', '-4', '3.5', '+3.5', '-3.5' 

HTML Parser
Write a program that extracts a title of a HTML file and all the content in its body. When you do that, print the result in the following format:
"Title: {extracted title}"
"Content: {extracted content}"
The content should be a single string. There might be different tags inside of the body, which you must ignore. You extract only the text without the tags. The input will be on a single line.
